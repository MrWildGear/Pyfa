# Smoke tests

This directory is for **high-level smoke tests** that exercise a broad range of code without targeting a single method.

Use `test_smoketests` when you want to verify that complex scenarios work end-to-end (e.g. a fit with a booster and a specific character). For low-level, method-specific tests, use `test_modules` instead and mirror the source layout there.

See [Writing tests for Pyfa](../../docs/writing-tests.md) (from repo root: `docs/writing-tests.md`) for full guidelines.
